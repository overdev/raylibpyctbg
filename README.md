# Raylib Ctypes Binding Generator

A very basic raylib binding generator for Python

This tool generates Python bindings for the awesome C library [Raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib).
It makes use of json files generated by the Raylib's header parser.

## Usage

Dowload and unzip it in a directory of you choosing, then, in the command line:
```
$ python path\to\raylibpyctbg path\to\raylib_api.json path\to\output\python\file [options]
```

**Options:**

- `--type-hint`: Adds type hinting to functions

  ```python
  def get_mouse_y() -> int:
      # type: () -> int
      ...
  ```

- `--type-annotate`: Adds type annotation to functions

  ```python
  def set_mouse_position(x: int, y: int) -> None:
      ...
  ```

- `--document`: Generates an API reference of this Python binding in markdown

  The file will be created in the same directory of the binding `.py` file.

## Customization

You can then customize the output to fit any need you may have. One default
customization that this wrapper includes:

### `Vector[2|3|4]` swizzling:

```python

vec2 = Vector2(1, 2, 3)
vec3 = vec2.xyx
vec4 = vec3.yyzx
vec3.xz = 5.0, 3.0
```

It also works for `Color`:
```python
col = Color(127, 63, 31, 255)
col2 = col.grab
col.rg = 255, 0
```

### A little of OOP:

Thanks to the _binding metadata_ file, some wrapped structs have functions bound as methods:

```python
# Load the sound; same as `sound = load_sound('my/sound/file')`
sound = Sound.load("my/sound/file")

# same as `if not is_sound_playing(sound)`
if not sound.is_playing():
	# Play it; same as `load_play(sound)`
	sound.play()

# Unload from memory; same as `unload_sound(sound)`
sound.unload()
```

### RayMath

Functions in the raymath.h are also available

## Using the python binging

Please, note that this binding does not include any raylib binary file. You can grab the binary 
from the C Raylib repo in the releases page. By default is expected the binary files to be
located inside '/bin/32bit' or '/bin/64bit' relative to where the python binding is located.

Then, you can just:
```python
import raylib as rl
```
